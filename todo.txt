Setting ideas:
victorian era prison ship
steampunk
you get different parts to upgrade your suit

There are no human guards on the ship, and the only humans are the prisoners
You have to go through rooms destroying the robot guards


Gameplay:
you attack robots and they drop parts or gears
gears are the unit of currency
you can pay other prisoners at their shops with gears and buy parts specifically
you could have keys just because every game needs keys

keys
bombs

you have no memory and you have to figure out why you are on the ship
in order to get the full story, you have to keep playing through multiple times

the ship's layout is generated on game start, and there are 5 floors of a certain number of rooms each, and there is always a fixed number of rooms.  The contents are always random, but there are certain room clusters like:
    kitchen
    cells
    engine room
    torpedo room
    bathrooms
    solitary confinement
    exercise rooms
    deck
    trash compactor
    store room
    execution room
    graveyard
    infirmary
    laundry room
    security center with screens
    keel
    captain's quarters
    crew's quarters
    lifeboats
    chapel
    workshop
    storage
    armory
    library
    lookout tower
    bridge
    hallways
    bed rooms



List of things David doesn't like in games
turn based combat
long lasting not undoable decisions
branching paths
skip parts of the game without knowing what I'm skipping
getting lost


I don't like feeling like I've missed something in a game
If not fully linear, perhaps the story could be done in such a way that you can't miss things

Maybe story parts of the game are chokepoints
Maybe places where you get items are also chokepoints
The exploration part can branch as much as we want, but you only get disposable items in those sections?

Multple story sections that can be completed in parallel, but are themselves linear



How does the game work?
Sections of the map are always the same, and there are map files for them as well as the objects in those parts (cities, outposts, etc)

The areas between these story areas are randomly generated, with the idea that a single story could be played through multiple times with a different experience each time?

You might go slowly through it the first time to get the full story and you might go speedy quick through the next time to speedrun

Maybe have a way for players/modders to make their own scenaries

Combat:
You are a guy and you move with wasd and you shoot with arrow keys
you can also use items that have either a cooldown time or we could just blatantly rip off boi and have a rooms cleared charge time

Maybe use the stacking objects on top of each other bug as a mine?

Everything your character can do is provided by an item
When you start out, you can't do anything except for move slowly

Nothing happens to your character apart from the items you get
No experience points
Maybe there is money
No number based stats, more skill based to advance

In order to get the full story, you have to play the game through more than once, but playing through the whole game once doesn't take very long.  Instead of playing it through once or maybe twice, the game is designed to support playing through lots and lots of times, with each time lasting an hour at most.

The story is delivered in small bite sized vignettes.
The story doesn't have a climax, it is just experiencing a world?

Every cutscene could be randomly placed on the map
Every room is designed, but the locations are random each time, and you come across short ~10 second cut scenes

Have to figure out why the game ends.

There are a bunch of cutscenes that have different attributes, and how you play through the game determines which cutscenes are played, using weighted randomness

You would get items for:
    running
    rolling
    jumping
    flying
    shooting
    throwing
    picking up pots
    swording
    talk to chickens
    etc
    dancing

On map load, all blank squares are procedurally generated, and maybe even change every time you enter them

Map screen similar to zelda for gb as well
use a maze algorithm?
quadrant tree map generation methodology


I'd like a game that encourages experimentation with the games' mechanics, so choices are never long lasting, or at least are always undoable

Maybe all of your stats are determined by the items you pick up, and you can at any time add or remove items from your inventory




-- Someday features
add tanks with cowboy hat on top
add hats
add slippery tiles
add roller skates
add unicycles
add zafad
add ability to kill npcs if they get annoying
add ear protectors that reduce the volume of all sounds


-- Gameplay example scenario:
you go to the shores and you see the cutscene
this puts the guy in the town square
you go talk to the guy and you get him somehow
you take him back to the girl and talk to her and they are happily ever after'd
then roll the credits
