game is made up of rooms
the rooms could have
    an ecs for parts
    physics thing based off of the ecs

serialize and deserialize for the whole room state
and you put the unloaded rooms into a file
you just load the room on enter and save it on exit
this also saves the game on every room enter

at the beginning of the run, you could generate a file of every room








if an enemy dies, all of the parts become loose
    if you punch a part it turns into gears


class Command
    has many parts
    stats for the whole

class Part
    has many joints
    has physics body

class Joint
    strength

a part needs:
    physics body
    physics shape
    physics fixture
    graphic
    strength

parts connected by joints


part

joint
    box2d joint
    strength

command



day/night cycle


player starts with a command module and maybe one gun
as you defeat enemies, they drop parts and gears
you can buy parts with gears
you can also scavenge parts that fall off of enemies
enemies are made up of the exact same parts as you

you assign every functioning thing to a keyboard key

the parts you pick up have memory logs that contribute to the story
figure out why you are on the ship
why the ship is exploding
why the ship is a prison ship
The different parts of the ship could have different kinds of logs, and different kinds of parts

easy and advanced controls
potentially upgrade existing parts

if this is a prison ship in space
    the inmates could still sell you parts
    other inmates can upgrade parts with gears
    inmates also give story elements

todo:
    have parts on the ground
    implement gluing on parts with the mouse
    implement assigning a key to some pieces to fire
    create parts:
        square with 4 mount points
        cannon with one mount point and opposite opening












hold down fire to increase accuracy
move curser further away to increase accuracy


allow items to modify your shot
make enemies based on what items they have



starts you with random items and in a random location on the ship at the beginning of the run

vents to connect foors

different areas of the ship are more unlocked if you get keys from things
enemies are made up of random parts
they always drop gears, and have a random chance of dropping something larger that they were carrying
randomize bosses

add a hunger component?

add familiars
add cosmetic items

implement momentum and knockback

you can take off any item at any time, even going without any items to be at base stats

what determines heat:
    moving increases it slightly
    shooting increases based on force

    Resistance - Jecat2
    Battle of the Lost - Rnm161

a set number of health
an energy level that powers weapons and shields?
if shield at zero take health damage

speed - determined by weight and powerups
energy - find energy tanks throughout the run
health - can be upgraded
cooling - how fast your heat goes down
if you get too hot you explode

you can hold on to items without activating them

trade items with other people
the ship is sinking to give a feel of urgency

--[[
--all you have to do is decide what to equip,
--and the game will arrange the items
--in a suitable fashion
--power headband - add small amounts of defense
--arm cannon
--speed boots
--cooling fans
]]--

after certain amounts of time, the ship explodes a little more and parts are impassable or more dangerous

All items improve your power in some way, but add weight
The more weight you have the slower you go
At the beginning you are at top speed, the more items you add you get slower





Features:

        use the mouse to move items around
        all items stay the same in value, and higher cost items in general are better
        each number key is an item slot, hit the key over an item to switch it out with another
        if parts are only for a certain slot, just hit the swap key?
        as you kill more enemies, you get a higher amount of total value, and selling things allows you to replace your current suit pieces with better ones

    add ngccgui


    combat:
        make gears have friction

        Backstory:
            You are a prisoner on a prison ship, and you have just realized
            that the ship has been abandoned, and it is also sinking somehow
            If you don't get off the ship before 1 hour you lose, and your
            score is determined mostly by how fast you get off the ship?

            The other prisoners are npcs and are also trying to get off the ship, and you can trade parts with them as they try to escape too?
            Maybe even be competitive with them?

            Why are robots attacking?
            It could add a sense of urgency if there is a countdown timer,
            and the ship feels like it is falling apart (screen shake), and
            occasionally there are cutscenes of more structural damage.

            Every few time intervals (10 minutes or so), there is a short
            cutscene and the ship changes somehow (is more broken up, more
            fires, etc)
            Robots get stronger/weaker depending on how much time has gone past?
            Certain rooms become impassable? (wouldn't be a problem necessarily if there are many routes through the ship)

        overarching goal: you are assembling your power suit parts
            to be strong enough to take out the final boss whenever you feel like it
            you could try to speedrun if you wanted, or wait until you are
            way op to fight the boss

            the big boss is guarding the lifeboats and you have to get past
            it to get off the boat
        there is a timer above the boat at all times, maybe there is an 
            incentive somehow to get off quickly

        cutscenes happen as you enter rooms and don't take away your controls
        or cutscenes don't increment the timer?

        use items from the inventory
        make enemies drop a gear every time a certain amount of damage threshold has passed
            enemy has 10 hp and drops 5 gears total, every 2 hp you do the enemy drops a gear

    animations:
        player animations
        enemy animations
        npc animations

    world generation:
        remove doors from edge rooms
        make more levels

    enemies:
        enemy health
        enemy death
        particles for explosions
        make more enemies
        make graphics for enemies

    cutscenes:
        make more cutscenes

    story:
        write the story

    npcs:
        ability to talk to npcs
        
    level editor:
        essential:
            layer editing 
            placing enemies/items
            cutscene editor
            selecting the room type

        convenience:
            fill tool
            right click to select tile under the cursor
            right click and drag to select a rectangle of tiles under the cursor
            eraser tool
            select regions of tiles on the tile palate
            make the walls not editable and generated based on adjacent rooms

    misc:
        profile to figure out what causes the slow start

    monitization:
        add hats
        gumroad integration


Game design ideas:

Setting ideas:
victorian era prison ship
steampunk
you get different parts to upgrade your suit

There are no human guards on the ship, and the only humans are the prisoners
You have to go through rooms destroying the robot guards


Gameplay:
you attack robots and they drop parts or gears
gears are the unit of currency
you can pay other prisoners at their shops with gears and buy parts specifically
you could have keys just because every game needs keys

keys
bombs

you have no memory and you have to figure out why you are on the ship
in order to get the full story, you have to keep playing through multiple times

the ship's layout is generated on game start, and there are 5 floors of a certain number of rooms each, and there is always a fixed number of rooms.  The contents are always random, but there are certain room clusters like:
    kitchen
    cells
    engine room
    torpedo room
    bathrooms
    solitary confinement
    exercise rooms
    deck
    trash compactor
    store room
    execution room
    graveyard
    infirmary
    laundry room
    security center with screens
    keel
    captain's quarters
    crew's quarters
    lifeboats
    chapel
    workshop
    storage
    armory
    library
    lookout tower
    bridge
    hallways
    bed rooms



List of things David doesn't like in games
turn based combat
long lasting not undoable decisions
branching paths
skip parts of the game without knowing what I'm skipping
getting lost


I don't like feeling like I've missed something in a game
If not fully linear, perhaps the story could be done in such a way that you can't miss things

Maybe story parts of the game are chokepoints
Maybe places where you get items are also chokepoints
The exploration part can branch as much as we want, but you only get disposable items in those sections?

Multple story sections that can be completed in parallel, but are themselves linear



How does the game work?
Sections of the map are always the same, and there are map files for them as well as the objects in those parts (cities, outposts, etc)

The areas between these story areas are randomly generated, with the idea that a single story could be played through multiple times with a different experience each time?

You might go slowly through it the first time to get the full story and you might go speedy quick through the next time to speedrun

Maybe have a way for players/modders to make their own scenaries

Combat:
You are a guy and you move with wasd and you shoot with arrow keys
you can also use items that have either a cooldown time or we could just blatantly rip off boi and have a rooms cleared charge time

Maybe use the stacking objects on top of each other bug as a mine?

Everything your character can do is provided by an item
When you start out, you can't do anything except for move slowly

Nothing happens to your character apart from the items you get
No experience points
Maybe there is money
No number based stats, more skill based to advance

In order to get the full story, you have to play the game through more than once, but playing through the whole game once doesn't take very long.  Instead of playing it through once or maybe twice, the game is designed to support playing through lots and lots of times, with each time lasting an hour at most.

The story is delivered in small bite sized vignettes.
The story doesn't have a climax, it is just experiencing a world?

Every cutscene could be randomly placed on the map
Every room is designed, but the locations are random each time, and you come across short ~10 second cut scenes

Have to figure out why the game ends.

There are a bunch of cutscenes that have different attributes, and how you play through the game determines which cutscenes are played, using weighted randomness

You would get items for:
    running
    rolling
    jumping
    flying
    shooting
    throwing
    picking up pots
    swording
    talk to chickens
    etc
    dancing


Map screen similar to zelda for gb as well


I'd like a game that encourages experimentation with the games' mechanics, so choices are never long lasting, or at least are always undoable

Maybe all of your stats are determined by the items you pick up, and you can at any time add or remove items from your inventory




-- Someday features
add tanks with cowboy hat on top
add hats
add slippery tiles
add roller skates
add unicycles
add zafad
add ability to kill npcs if they get annoying
add ear protectors that reduce the volume of all sounds


-- Gameplay example scenario:
you go to the shores and you see the cutscene
this puts the guy in the town square
you go talk to the guy and you get him somehow
you take him back to the girl and talk to her and they are happily ever after'd
then roll the credits
