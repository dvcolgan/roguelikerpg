You go to the shores screen

        see a cut scene
            prevent player from moving
            place girl in location
            place guy in location
            guy says 'I don\'t want you anymore.'
            girl says cry
            walk guy towards you
            guy says words 'what do you want? go away'
            guy walks off screen
            delete guy from room
            give back control
            girl dialog 'I am become sad.'
    else
        npc girl sits there cry, says 'Please go get my boyfriend back.'
        if you give boyfriend back
            npc girl says yay and kiss
